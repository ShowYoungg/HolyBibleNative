## Used Libraries

## Project Overview
I did productionize this app, taking it from a no state to a production-ready state. This involves finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding many prepackaged databases, optimising SQLite database and adding a library.

## Why this Project?
During lockdown imposed by the Nigerian Government necessitated by COVID 19, I had more time to read Bibles and wanted a Bible app with many versions and offline capability which can play audio of the texts written there, I searched tirelessly without finding a favourable one: hence, I decided to find a solution.
